When designing a natural toothpaste containing royal jelly, you can consider the following aspects to enhance product appeal:

Iconic Packaging Design: Use fresh and natural colors, such as green or honey, to highlight the product's natural ingredients. You can incorporate patterns or symbols of royal jelly on the packaging to emphasize the product's unique components.

Clear and Concise Information: Provide clear and concise information on the packaging, emphasizing the product's natural characteristics and the benefits of royal jelly. Use readable fonts and ensure consumers can quickly understand the product's advantages.

Sustainable Packaging: Consider using sustainable materials or recyclable packaging to attract environmentally conscious consumers. Highlight sustainability information on the packaging to underscore the company's commitment to the environment.

Eye-catching Labels: Emphasize the natural ingredients of royal jelly on the product labels, using attention-grabbing language such as "all-natural" or "no artificial additives."

Comfortable Appearance: Choose a packaging shape that is easy to grip, ensuring users feel comfortable when using the product. Consider designing packaging that is easy to squeeze to enhance the user experience.

Relevant Illustrations or Photos: Add eco-friendly and natural illustrations or photos on the packaging to emphasize the natural origin of the product. Include patterns such as bees or flowers that align with the concept of royal jelly.

Highlight Product Advantages: Emphasize the benefits of royal jelly on the packaging, such as promoting oral health, anti-inflammatory properties, or antioxidant benefits. This can be achieved through brief slogans or graphics.

User-friendly Instructions: Provide clear and simple usage instructions to ensure users understand how to use the product correctly for optimal results.

Remember that packaging design is not just about the product's appearance; it should also convey the product's values, brand philosophy, and connection with consumers.
